## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Project RACCOON Code of Conduct](https://github.com/moritzobenauer/ProjectRaccoon/contributing/codeofconduct.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/moritzobenauer/ProjectRaccoon/blob/main/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/moritzobenauer/ProjectRaccoon/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/moritzobenauer/ProjectRaccoon/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/moritzobenauer/ProjectRaccoon/blob/main/README.md). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/moritzobenauer/ProjectRaccoonissues?q=label%3Abug).
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/moritzobenauer/ProjectRaccoon/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

### Suggesting Enhancements / New Monomers

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Project RACCOON, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement / New Monomer

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/moritzobenauer/ProjectRaccoon/blob/main/README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality / monomeric building block is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/moritzobenauer/ProjectRaccoon/issues) to see if the enhancement / monomer has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement / New Monomer Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/moritzobenauer/ProjectRaccoon/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion / new monomer.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Project RACCOON users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
- **For new monomers** you may post your *monomers.json* file.
