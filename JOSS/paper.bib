abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations play an increasingly important role in the rational design of (nano)-materials and in the study of biomacromolecules. However, generating input files and realistic starting coordinates for these simulations is a major bottleneck, especially for high throughput protocols and for complex multi-component systems. To eliminate this bottleneck, we present the polyply software suite that provides 1) a multi-scale graph matching algorithm designed to generate parameters quickly and for arbitrarily complex polymeric topologies, and 2) a generic multi-scale random walk protocol capable of setting up complex systems efficiently and independent of the target force-field or model resolution. We benchmark quality and performance of the approach by creating realistic coordinates for polymer melt simulations, single-stranded as well as circular single-stranded DNA. We further demonstrate the power of our approach by setting up a microphase-separated block copolymer system, and by generating a liquid-liquid phase separated system inside a lipid vesicle. To facilitate the rational design of (nano)-materials and biomacromolecules by MD simulations, the authors present the polyply suite, featuring a graph matching algorithm and a random walk protocol for generating multi-scale polymeric topologies and initial coordinates.}},

New torsional potentials were optimized based on density functional theory (DFT) scans at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p) level for potential energy surfaces of the backbone α and γ dihedral angles. In combination with previously reported improvements for the sugar puckering and glycosidic torsion terms, the new force field was validated through diverse molecular dynamics simulations for RNAs in aqueous solution. Results for dinucleotides and tetranucleotides revealed both accurate reproduction of 3 J couplings from NMR and the avoidance of several unphysical states observed with other force fields. Simulations of larger systems with noncanonical motifs showed significant structural improvements over the previous OPLS-AA parameters. The new force field, OPLS-AA/M, is expected to perform competitively with other recent RNA force fields and to be compatible with OPLS-AA models for proteins and small molecules.}},

abstract = {{We have previously proposed a method for refining force-field parameters of protein systems, which consists of minimising the summation of the square of the force acting on each atom in the proteins with the structures from the protein data bank (PDB). The results showed that the modified force-field parameters for all-atom model gave structures more consistent with the experimental implications than the original force fields. In this work, we applied this method and a new method to the OPLS–UA force field. In the new method, we perform a minimisation of the average of the root-mean-square deviation of various protein structures from the native structure. We selected some torsion-energy parameters for this optimisation, and 100 molecules from the PDB were used. The results imply that the new force-field parameters gave structures of two peptides more consistent with the experimental implications for the secondary structure-forming tendencies than the original OPLS–UA force field.}},

These materials are practically useful in biological applications, such as drug delivery, DNA/gene delivery, and antimicrobial coatings, as well as nonbiological applications, such as electronics, separations, optics, and sensing. Given their broad applicability, there is motivation to understand the molecular and macroscale structure, dynamics, and thermodynamic behavior exhibited by such materials. We focus on the past and ongoing molecular simulation studies aimed at obtaining such fundamental understanding and predicting molecular design rules for the target function. We describe briefly the experimental work in this field that validates or motivates these computational studies. We also describe the various models (e.g., atomistic, coarse-grained, or hybrid) and simulation methods (e.g., stochastic versus deterministic, enhanced sampling) that have been used and the types of questions that have been answered using these computational approaches.}},

abstract = {Abstract CHARMM is an academic research program used widely for macromolecular mechanics and dynamics with versatile analysis and manipulation tools of atomic coordinates and dynamics trajectories. CHARMM-GUI, http://www.charmm-gui.org, has been developed to provide a web-based graphical user interface to generate various input files and molecular systems to facilitate and standardize the usage of common and advanced simulation techniques in CHARMM. The web environment provides an ideal platform to build and validate a molecular model system in an interactive fashion such that, if a problem is found through visual inspection, one can go back to the previous setup and regenerate the whole system again. In this article, we describe the currently available functional modules of CHARMM-GUI Input Generator that form a basis for the advanced simulation techniques. Future directions of the CHARMM-GUI development project are also discussed briefly together with other features in the CHARMM-GUI website, such as Archive and Movie Gallery. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
